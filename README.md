# NOTE
### The Project binlocator-v1 was awarded first prize in the below mentioned hackathon. After almost a year, I'm trying to improve the usability by removing the bugs, impreoving existing features and adding new ones. Because of a completely new repository, all the previous deployments will not be updated anymore. From now on, the only live link is [https://binlocator.anurags.tech](https://binlocator.anurags.tech)

# `NOTE`

If you're planning to run this app locally, YOU MUST SETUP YOUR POSTGRESQL SERVER AND UPDATE URL IN .ENV FILE. OTHERWISE IT SIMPLY WON'T RUN. THE SCHEMA FOR DB TABLE IS IN QUERY FILE.
